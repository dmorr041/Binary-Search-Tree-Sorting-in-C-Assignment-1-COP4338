# Binary-Search-Tree-Sorting-in-C-Assignment-1-COP4338
Implements a binary search tree in C. We have functions to compare two strings for equality (one compares case sensitive while the other compares case insensitive), as well as an insert function to properly insert a string into the tree and a print function to print the strings in the tree using an inorder traversal. Prints the words with the lowest ACII values first. Also includes a delete tree function. Covers File I/O, Binary Search Tree data structure, command line parsing using getopt, dynamic memory allocation, custom functions, and reclamation of memory that is allocated.
